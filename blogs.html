                <h2>Will AI Replace Software Engineers?</h2>
                <p>Scroll through social media long enough and you’ll hear the same line on repeat 
                    “AI is going to replace software engineers.” Most of the time, these claims don’t
                    even come from people in the industry. They’re just repeating what they’ve heard
                    from others.But here’s the truth those of us who actually use AI tools while building
                    projects see a very different picture.</p>

            <h2>How it started vs.how it's going</h2>
            <p>I was never the typical "tech guy." If I counted all the computer games I've played, I'd barely fill one 
                hand. My interests always leaned toward math, physics, and figuring out how things work.I wasn't 
                brilliant at any of these subjects, but they genuinely excited me there's something addictive 
                about understanding why complex systems tick the way they do. Life took me down various paths, and eventually 
                I circled back to computer science after more than ten years away from it. What caught me off guard was how 
                natural it felt to return. The same curiosity that used to drive me through math problems and physics concepts 
                now lights up when I'm working through algorithms or understanding how systems are built.</p>

                </summary>
                <p> Technology became my 
                    new playground for curiosity, where every challenge isn't just something to fix, but a chance to understand 
                    something deeper about how we structure information and make things work automatically. The more I got into it, 
                    the clearer it became that computer science is about way more than just writing code. You need patience to work 
                    through complicated logic step by step, creativity to build elegant solutions from vague requirements, and the 
                    grit to keep going when everything seems broken. Those error messages that used to drive me crazy? They became 
                    my teachers, giving me exact feedback about what I didn't understand yet. I started seeing that real progress 
                    doesn't come from avoiding mistakes it comes from getting better at learning from them.Maybe the biggest change
                    has been learning how to teach myself. Without a tech family background or years of programming experience, I've 
                    had to figure out my own way of learning things. That meant spending hours pulling together information from different 
                    sources, playing around with concepts until they clicked, and building projects that stretched what I thought I 
                    could do. Whether I was struggling with making websites work on phones or putting together my first complete web 
                    application, each breakthrough felt like proof that I could actually bridge the gap between understanding something 
                    in theory and making it work in practice. What gets me most excited isn't just what I've learned so far it's realizing 
                    how much more there is to discover. Technology keeps evolving, which means learning never really stops. Instead of 
                    seeing this as some exhausting race to keep up, I see it as a promise that I'll never run out of interesting things 
                    to explore. It's like having a career where curiosity is actually your main tool. This whole thing is more than 
                    just switching careers it's like having an intellectual awakening. I'm seeing how the thinking skills I developed 
                    in one area can be incredibly useful in another, how subjects that seem completely different often work 
                    in surprisingly similar ways, and how staying curious might actually be more important than mastering any 
                    particular technology. Moving forward, I'm not just thinking about the next programming language to learn or 
                    the latest framework to pick up. I'm looking forward to the complex problems I haven't encountered yet, the clever 
                    solutions I haven't thought of, and how this journey will keep changing not just what I can build professionally, but how I approach understanding and working with our increasingly complex world.
