        <p class="aboutPara">Hi, I'm <strong>Vishal Sudasinghe</strong>, a Computer Science student at the <strong>University of Westminster</strong> with a growing passion for building clean, interactive, and user friendly web applications.
            I’m still new to this industry, and that curiosity pushes me every day. I love exploring new technologies, frameworks, design patterns, and anything that lets me turn a simple idea into a real product. I get tired of boring UIs so I challenge myself to make every project engaging, creative, and meaningful.
            For me, coding isn’t just about writing functions or completing assignments. It’s about crafting digital experiences that feel alive. When someone interacts with something I built and enjoys it, that’s the moment I feel like all the effort was worth it.
            Of course, I’m still learning. Some theoretical concepts will come and go, get stuck, frustrate me...<br /><br /><br />
            But the excitement of creating something visually appealing and functional that feeling always stays. It reminds me why I started this journey.
            I believe technology should be simple, aesthetic, and human-centric. I want to build products that people love using not because they have to, but because they want to.
            This is just the beginning for me. Every project is a new opportunity. Every bug is a new lesson. And every line of code brings me closer to the developer I want to become. I’m growing with purpose and I’m excited to see how far I can take this.
            I’m not afraid to experiment, break things, and rebuild them better. Creativity excites me. Challenges shape me. And every small win reminds me that progress is happening even when I don’t notice it.
            One day, I want to look back at this exact moment and say,
            “That spark… that hunger to create, that’s what built my career.”
            So here I am learning, building, and dreaming big.
            Not perfect. Not experienced.
            Just passionate and moving forward with purpose.
